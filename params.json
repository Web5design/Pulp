A fresly-squeezed Pulp app looks like this:\r\n\r\n    MyApp/\r\n      Gemfile\r\n      MyApp.rb\r\n      Rakefile\r\n      app-config.json\r\n      config.ru\r\n      controllers/\r\n      db/\r\n        config.json\r\n      helpers/\r\n      lang/\r\n        en-us.rb\r\n      models/\r\n      public/\r\n        img/\r\n          icon-114.png\r\n          icon-16.png\r\n          icon-57.png\r\n          icon-72.png\r\n          index.html\r\n        js/\r\n          app.js\r\n          index.html\r\n          jquery.min.js\r\n        styles/\r\n          css/\r\n          font/\r\n            fontawesome-webfont.eot\r\n            fontawesome-webfont.svg\r\n            fontawesome-webfont.ttf\r\n            fontawesome-webfont.woff\r\n            index.html\r\n          index.html\r\n          less/\r\n            app.less\r\n            base.less\r\n            font_awesome.less\r\n            index.html\r\n            media_queries.less\r\n            prefixer.less\r\n      readme.md\r\n      tests/\r\n        app.rb\r\n      vendor/\r\n        code_statistics.rb\r\n      views/\r\n        error.erb\r\n        index.erb\r\n        layout.erb\r\n        not_found.erb\r\n\r\nPulp includes the following gems by default:\r\n\r\n  * sinatra\r\n  * thin\r\n  * activerecord\r\n  * sinatra-activerecord\r\n  * bcrypt-ruby\r\n  * json\r\n  * mysql\r\n  * sqlite3\r\n  * pony\r\n\r\nYour application's config file is `app-config.json` and the database configuration file can be found at `db/config.json`. A rackup config file is also included.\r\n\r\nOnce the app is generated, you'll need to CD into the folder and run Bundler to install the gems.\r\n\r\n    bundle install\r\n\r\nAfter you've configured your database, you can create migrations using the `db:create_migration` rake task. You must pass a `NAME` argument, like so:\r\n\r\n    rake db:create_migration NAME=my_sample_migration\r\n\r\nOnce you're done editing your migration files, rune `rake db:migrate` just like you would in Rails. \r\n\r\nTo see a list of all available Rake tasks, run `rake -T`.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to simply use the front end boilerplate, it's packaged separately inside of the `frontend.zip` file. It's important that you leave the original `frontend.zip` file in the same directory as the `pulp.sh` file - Pulp extracts the front end boilerplate from this zip to place inside of your application.\r\n\r\n###Credits\r\n\r\nPulp includes [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome) for awesome font icons.\r\n\r\nPulp also includes a copy of [jQuery](http://jquery.com)\r\n\r\nThe `stats` rake task uses a slightly modified version of the Rails code_statistics.rb file.\r\n\r\n###License\r\n\r\nPulp is licensed under the [CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
